Vanilla Forums integrates with a number of social applications that you can use as SSO solutions. Learn more about configuring these applications to work with your forum in this section.

## Github

This plugin allows you to submit user discussion and comments as GitHub issues.

### Setup Instructions

If you already have a Github account, you need to enable API Access for this plugin to work.

1. [Create a new application in GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications/new), and set the callback URL by appending `/profile/githubconnect` to the end of your forum’s URL. (If your forum is at `example.com/forum`, your callback URL would be `http://example.com/forum/profile/githubconnect`).
2. Once your application has been set up, you must copy the **ClientID** and **Secret** into your Github plugin settings page from your Vanilla dashboard.
3. Enter the repositories you want to be allowed into your Github plugin settings page from your Vanilla dashboard.

## Facebook

Facebook Connect allows users to sign in using their Facebook account. You must register your application with Facebook for this plugin to work.

### How to set up Facebook Connect

In order to set up Facebook Connect, you must create an "application" in Facebook at: [https://developers.facebook.com/apps](https://developers.facebook.com/apps)

Once your application has been set up, you must copy the "Application ID" and "Application Secret" into your Facebook plugin settings page from your Vanilla dashboard.

Please note that the 'Valid oAuth Redirect URI" should be: 
https://community.yoursite.com/entry/connect/facebook or 
https://yoursite.vanillacommunities.com/entry/connect/facebook if you do not have custom domain.
