This is for packaged, gold releases of the self-hosted product. We publish beta and release candidate change logs on the [forum](https://open.vanillaforums.com/categories/blog). We provide separate [cloud release notes](http://docs.vanillaforums.com/help/releases/) since they are scheduled differently.
